# The CrossFit&reg; Workouts of the Day, in a feed

This is a quick and dirty scrape of the [CrossFit&reg; Workout of the Day archive](https://www.crossfit.com/workout) converted to the [JSON Feed](https://jsonfeed.org) format.

You can subscribe to the feed at http://wod-feed.cheerschopper.com

### Why JSON Feed?
It was the easiest to implement. Ruby and JSON are extremely compatible.
